        <h1>The Governors Ball</h1>
        <img width=200px src=1.jpeg>
        <p> My first time going to Gov Ball, an annual music festival located in Queens. I went with a group of friends on a cloudy Sunday. I went to mainly see two rappers I was a fan of. I met my friends on the 7 train on the way to Citi Field. We arrived around morning time and it was cloudy so I dressed accordingly. When you first get to Gov ball you have to go through security. Apparently you aren't allowed backpacks at Gov ball and of course I had my backpack on me because I take a bag everywhere. I ended up hiding my bag full of all my belongings behind a tree praying nobody would take it. When we made it to the mosh pits there were men, women, children, and everybody in between there. Ken Carson; an upcoming rapper was my first true music festival experience. The mosh pits were hot with all the people crowded together jumping around leaving a stench I’ll never forget. Regardless, the excitement before he came out to perform was real. The performance was electrifying. When I was in the mosh pits even though I was with my friends I interacted with a lot of random people and had a good time. After I went to eat, there was about a full day before the main performance at night. So my friends and I did what we could and went on to enjoy these different genres of music stepping out of our comfort zone as other music fans did during Ken Carson’s performance. We had a good time and all made positive memories with random people. During Carti who was headlining, you’d see a mob of his supporters, cameramen, and all kinds of people. During the performance, you’d see people picking others up so they don’t get hurt in such a crowd. There’s no room to move but people look out for each other. After the festival I found a larger group of teens who I sort of knew and we talked like we've known each other for the longest. On top of that, I found my bag! </p>
        <p>Gov ball has been a music festival for the longest time. The first time I heard about it I was about 9 years old and my older sister was talking to me about her experience. She loved it and at the time I didn’t understand why. Now that I’m older I realize that Gov ball is an experience where people can come and see their favorite artists perform but they can also build bonds with their community and interact with different types of people. I think the location changed but that hasn’t changed the culture of the event at all. Gov ball is similar to all the other music festivals but different in the sense that it is all types of music which brings a larger variety of people together. It is different from my hood and a lot of the rest of the city because it’s a bigger and open space where hundreds of people come for one reason, to enjoy music. It is similar to New York in the sense that it’s a lot of people but not in the same way. It’s also similar because of the fact that it’s all different kinds of people in one space. I would describe this experience as a fun, engaging and tiring experience for people that enjoy music. Gov ball symbolizes togetherness in NYC.</p>
